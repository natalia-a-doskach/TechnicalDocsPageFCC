      <h2><span>What is JavaScript, really?</span></h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla
        Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.<br />
        JavaScript is incredibly versatile. You can start small, with carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts, and responses to button clicks. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive
        database-driven apps, and much more!<br />
        JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very flexible. Developers have written a large variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra functionality with minimum effort. These include:
        <ul>
          <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) — APIs built into web browsers, providing functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from the user's webcam, or
            generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
          <li>Third-party APIs to allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
          <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries you can apply to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications.
            Because this article is only supposed to be a light introduction to JavaScript, we are not going to confuse you at this stage by talking in detail about what the difference is between the core JavaScript language and the different tools
            listed above. You can learn all that in detail later on, in our JavaScript learning area, and in the rest of MDN.</li>
        </ul>
        Below we will introduce you to some aspects of the core language, and you'll also play with a few browser API features too. Have fun!</p>

    <section class="main-section" id='Hello_world'>
      <h2><span>A "hello world" example</span></h2>
      <p>The above section might sound really exciting, and so it should — JavaScript is one of the most lively web technologies, and as you start to get good at using it, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.<br>
        However, becoming comfortable with JavaScript is a little harder than becoming comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small and keep working in small consistent steps. To start, we'll show how to add some basic JavaScript to
        your
        page, creating a "hello world!" example (the standard in basic programming examples).</p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, go to your test site and create a new folder named 'scripts' (without the quotes). Then, within the new scripts folder you just created, create a new file called <kbd>main.js</kbd>. Save it in your <kbd>scripts</kbd> folder.</li>
        <li>Next, in your <kbd>index.html</kbd> file enter the following element on a new line just before the closing
          <kbd>&lt;/body></kbd> tag:<br />
          <code>
            &lt;script src="scripts/main.js"></script>
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>This is basically doing the same job as the
          <kbd>
            &lt;link></kbd> element for CSS — it applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).</li>
        <li>Now add the following code to the <kbd>main.js</kbd> file:<br /></li>
        <div><code>var myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');<br />
            myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';</code></div>
        <li>Finally, make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved, then load <kbd>index.html</kbd> in the browser.</li>
      </ol>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id='Variables'>
      <h2><span>Variables</span></h2>
      <p>Variables are containers that you can store values in. You start by declaring a variable with the var keyword, followed by any name you want to call it:</p>

      <div><code>var myVariable;</code></div>

      <p>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:</p>

      <div><code>myVariable = 'Bob';</code></div>
      <p>You can do both these operations on the same line if you wish:</p>

      <div><code>var myVariable = 'Bob';</code></div>
      <p>You can retrieve the value by just calling the variable by name:</p>

      <div><code>myVariable;</code></div>
      <p>After giving a variable a value, you can later choose to change it:</p>

      <div><code>var myVariable = 'Bob';<br />
          myVariable = 'Steve';</code></div>

      <p>So why do we need variables? Well, variables are needed to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change the image displayed in an
        image
        gallery.</p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id='Comments'>
      <h2><span>Comments</span></h2>
      <p>You can put comments into JavaScript code, just as you can in CSS:</p>
      <div><code>
          /*<br />
          Everything in between is a comment.<br />
          */
        </code></div>
      <p>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's often easier to put it behind two slashes like this:</p>

      <div><code> // This is a comment</code></div>

      <h2 id="Conditionals"><span>Conditionals</span></h2>
      <p>Conditionals are code structures which allow you to test if an expression returns true or not, running alternative code revealed by its result. A very common form of conditionals is the <kbd>if ... else statement</kbd>. For example:</p>
      <div><code>
          var iceCream = 'chocolate';<br />
          if (iceCream === 'chocolate') {<br />
          alert('Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!');<br />
          } else {<br />
          alert('Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...');<br />
          }
        </code></div>
      <p>
        The expression inside the <kbd>if ( ... )</kbd> is the test — this uses the identity operator (as described above) to compare the variable <kbd>iceCream</kbd> with the string <kbd>chocolate</kbd> to see if the two are equal. If this
        comparison returns <kbd>true</kbd>, the first block
        of code is run. If the comparison is not true, the first block is skipped and the second code block, after the <kbd>else</kbd> statement, is run instead.</p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id='Functions'>
      <h2><span>Functions</span></h2>
      <p>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. When you need the procedure you can call a function, with the function name, instead of rewriting the entire code each time. You have already seen some uses of functions
        above, for example:<p>

          <div><code>var myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');</code></div><br />
          <div><code>alert('hello!');</code></div>
          <p>These functions, <kbd>document.querySelector</kbd> and <kbd>alert</kbd>, are built into the browser for you to use whenever you desire.</p>

          <p>If you see something which looks like a variable name, but has parentheses — <kbd>()</kbd> — after it, it is likely a function. Functions often take arguments — bits of data they need to do their job. These go inside the parentheses,
            separated by
            commas if there is more than one argument.</p>

          <p>For example, the <kbd>alert()</kbd> function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string as an argument to tell the function what to write in the pop-up box.</p>

          <p>The good news is you can define your own functions — in this next example we write a simple function which takes two numbers as arguments and multiplies them:</p>

          <div><code>function multiply(num1,num2) {<br />
              var result = num1 * num2;<br />
              return result;<br />
              }</code></div>
          <p>Try running the above function in the console, then test with several arguments. For example:</p>

          <div><code>multiply(4, 7);<br />
              multiply(20, 20);<br />
              multiply(0.5, 3);<br /></code></div>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id='Events'>
      <h2><span>Events</span></h2>
      <p>Real interactivity on a website needs events. These are code structures which listen for things happening in browser, running code in response. The most obvious example is the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on
        something with your mouse. To demonstrate this, enter the following into your console, then click on the current webpage:</p>

      <div><code>document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {<br />
          alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');<br />
          }</code></div>
      <p>There are many ways to attach an event to an element. Here we select the <kbd>&lt;html></kbd> element, setting its <kbd>onclick</kbd> handler property equal to an anonymous (i.e. nameless) function, which contains the code we want the click
        event to run.</p>
